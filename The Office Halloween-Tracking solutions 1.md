# **The Office Halloween - Peacock**
## **Solutions for tracking problems**

### **Main branch:**
>In this branch, one of the solutions to make the suit, to solve the problem is to have a mesh for the face where it covers the entire face of the user and thus when moving with the pumpkin does not meet the face or pierce the face, for this we made another mesh for the neck so that it could not be transparent with the movement of the pumpkin.
We made another mesh for the neck so that it would not pierce the neck of the suit on the user's face, also we could fix that the mouth would not be transparent with the movement.
Also in this branch we implemented the solution of the suit tracking where the movement of the suit was followed by the movement of the face where depending on the rotation in the X and Y axes, the suit moved depending on the movement of the user's face.
For the movement of the pumpkin fall, we tracked the movement of the face with the Head Binding component where the user's face was indicated and then with script we made it appear in a part of the application part, and from there in part of the code we got the position of the user's face.
Then there we tracked the pumpkin with the face and then when we got the last moment of the head position it was adjusted after giving two quick bounces as if the pumpkin was falling.
