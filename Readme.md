# **The Office Halloween - Peacock**
## **Solutions for tracking problems**

### **UpperBodyTracking Branch:**
>In this branch was carried out the solutions of the suit, where the purpose of this branch was to implement a solution that could be coupled to the project and could solve the problems that were had for this is to have face mesh 
where it covers the entire face of the user and so when moving with the pumpkin does not join the face or transpase the face, for this we made another mesh for the neck so that it could not transpase the neck of the suit on the user's face, 
besides being able to fix that the mouth is not transparent with the movement. And for this, in the same way we implemented the improved tracking of the fall of the pumpkin for this, the movement of the fall of the pumpkin followed the movement of the face with the Head Binding component
where the user's face was indicated and then with script we made it appear in a part of the part of the application, and from there in part of the code we obtained the position of the user's face, then there we made the tracking of the pumpkin with the face and then at the last moment the position of the head was adjusted 
after giving two quick bounces as if the pumpkin was falling.
And then in the tracking of the improved suit, it was to have a 3D body tracking for this to work we needed the suit to fit the body of the previous component mentioned and so it was adjusted to the user's body and then also the advantage of using this option was that the suit was adjusted at all times to the movement of the user, in addition to adjusting to the movement of the user.
the suit to the user's movement, in addition to that we adjusted by means of the objects of the suit to some points of the body so that it was adjusted and joined to them.
